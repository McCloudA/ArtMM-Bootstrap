      <p>I think this is a more than fair, since $9.95 is about 1/6<sup>th</sup> of what you'll make in your first modeling gig. I'm also offering a 7 day refund policy, if you look over the materials and decide that I didn't include everything you need to start setting up art modeling gigs immediately.</p>
      <p>I really care about helping you start making money by art modeling. If you have any questions, before or after your purchase, please contact me and I'll get back to you within 24 - 48 hours during normal business hours. Have fun!</p>
