              <p class="lead">I'm Aaron McCloud, and I've been art modeling since the beginning of 2012. These days modeling makes up the bulk of my income and, though I'll never become part of the 1% by art modeling, it pays the bills and supports me.</p>
              <p class="lead">The story of how I started art modeling is rather odd. Especially since I was one of the awkward, dweeby kids in high school who knew pi to over 50 decimal places. I never thought I would be modeling professionally.</p>
              <p class="lead">I was having trouble making ends meet after graduating from college, and one morning I woke up next to my girlfriend at the time. She looked at me and said, "You know, you're gorgeous.‚Äù</p>
              <p class="lead"><em>Awwww...</em> I really didn't think so, but she persisted and helped set me up with my first few modeling gigs. I felt that it would be really awkward, and almost flaked on that first day, but I actually enjoyed my first gig. The money was pretty good, and well... the rest is history.</p>
              <p class="lead">I model in the Seattle area and built up a significant client base in a relatively short period of time. I treat modeling like any other job - I'm on time, professional, have business cards, and do my very best to communicate and make the entire drawing class experience enjoyable.</p>
